## Api Setup
[Install yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)
* It's like npm, but better. It's also best if we only use one package manager in the project, so let's use yarn. [Yarn vs Npm Commands](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/migrating-from-npm/)

Run `yarn install` inside the `api/` directory to install node modules

Run `yarn dev` to start the development server (restarts on saved changes)

## Flutter Setup
* Recommended to use the VSCode extension
  * Just hit "Run and Debug" in the debug menu on the left hand side toolbar
* If there are any issues with your flutter installation (missing dependencies), run `flutter doctor`
